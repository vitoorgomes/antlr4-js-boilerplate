# Antlr4 with JavaScript Boilerplate

It's very simple to use, all the required and example boilerplate is already done with scripts to automate the process.

## Requirements

- NodeJS
- JDK 8 or 11
- Yarn or NPM

## Installation

On the root directory
```bash
yarn
# or
npm install
```

## Running

An script is already done, so running one command line is enough to run everything at once

`yarn ant`

If you want to change it, just remove the `postant` from script and run manually:
- `yarn ant`
- `node ./compiler.js`
